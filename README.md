Build a application with a RESTFUL routes and full CRUD functionality.
Also for this rails application  it was required to use  certain gems for the application to function such as:

  gem 'omniauth'
  gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
  gem 'omniauth-google-oauth2'
  gem 'dotenv-rails'

My Comic app was build from front to back. All tables where created and migrated into the database that will allow the MVC flow properly.
